    <h2 id="introduction">2. Introduction</h2>
    <p>As urbanisation continues to surge, the demand for efficient and sustainable public transportation systems becomes also grows in tandem. As cities expand, infrastructure often struggles to keep pace with the growing population, leading to traffic congestion, air pollution, and inefficient public transportation systems. These issues not only hinder economic growth but also reduce the quality of life for residents. Among these challenges, urban mobility remains a critical concern, as existing systems fail to cater to the increasing demands of daily commuters. This project focuses on designing a smart city with a special emphasis on innovative solutions for its subway systems and networks.  Reading the white paper has made it clear that there is an immediate need for solutions that would change the world for the better. One of the prominent problems people are facing today is the ease of travel.
       Solving these urban challenges is essential to creating cities that are resilient and efficient. This project focuses on designing a smart city with advanced subway systems, using modern technologies to provide sustainable and effective transportation solutions. By reducing traffic congestion, cutting down carbon emissions, and improving access to public transport, the project aims to tackle the critical problems caused by urbanisation. It seeks to promote sustainable urban growth while addressing key societal issues such as mobility and accessibility disparities.</p> <!-- Add the rest of your content -->

    <h2 id="problem-statement">3. Problem Statement</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Domain</h3>
    <p>Implementation of an efficient Subway System:
Amongst the different modes of travel present today, railways and/or subway system is one of the cheapest and most frequently chosen mode of transport by the public. Today in India we face a myriad of problem in the railways system, be it overcrowding due to improper scheduling of trains or lack of facilities offered to the public waiting to board one. Efficient commute is the need of the hour and that provided us with the impetus to work on resolving this issue.

    <h3>3.2 Module Description</h3>
    <p>I am working on get the distance , get the time and safety management, get the distance function access the file that stores the graph of the whole subway system network , get the distance helps the user to get the shortest distance between the two stations using  Dijkstra’s Algorithm so that the user can know how much distance he should travel,  get the time is the function which helps the user to get to know for how much time the user

needs to travel , by finding shortest distance between the stations by again using Dijkstra’s Algorithm and then calculating the time by taking 40 km/hr as average speed of the metro, safety management finds the shortest distance towards the exit in case of emergency, and even tells user which exit is nearest.</p> <!-- Add content -->
